Hello, this is a public statement from The ResourceHub Team.

Today (03/09/2020 in DD/MM/YYYY) we were notified about a site distributing a "Crasher Goose". 

The mentioned site can be found at `sites[.]google[.]com/view/crasher-goose/home`.

After further research, we have noticed this site accepts donations for the "Crasher Goose". What's worse, the "Crasher Goose" website seems to be providing paid access to our website. We do not condone this.

However, what's **even** worse, the "Crasher Goose" seems to explicitly **BYPASS** the legal message, which Sam has asked to **NEVER** be done, **EVER**.

ResourceHub will **ALWAYS** be free to use. There will be no advertisements whatsoever, unless it is truly necessary.

We are **not** affiliated with the "Crasher Goose". The site has been reported to Google, and we're currently waiting for the site to be taken down.

Please check back for updates.
