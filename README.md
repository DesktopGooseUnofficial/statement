## Intro

Hello, this is a public statement from The ResourceHub Team.

Please check back for updates. This statement will be updated often.

Today (03/09/2020 in DD/MM/YYYY) we were notified about a site distributing a "Crasher Goose". 

The mentioned site can be found at `sites[.]google[.]com/view/crasher-goose/home`. DO NOT GO THERE UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

## Violations of requests and the ResourceHub rules

After further research, we have noticed this site accepts donations for the "Crasher Goose". What's worse, the "Crasher Goose" website seems to be providing paid access to our website. We do not condone this. The download links for the "Crasher Goose" also goes through Linkvertise, which Sam has also asked not to be done. No revenue should be earned off of the Desktop Goose.

However, what's **even** worse, the "Crasher Goose" seems to explicitly **BYPASS** the legal message, which Sam has asked to **NEVER** be done, **EVER**.

## The actual software

Installing the "Crasher Goose" seems impossible.

Linkvertise forces you to enable notifications and read articles before you can continue.

Once you do that, you get taken to yet another download page, asking you to get the Linkvertise Download Manager.

Once you do that though - the Linkvertise Download Manager is **unresponsive**. Meanwhile, in the background, the Linkvertise Download Manager sends requests to malicious sites.

The only thing you can do is to exit the Download Manager, which will place a shortcut on your desktop which allows you to open the Download Manager again.

It also seems to be a trojan.

## Outro

ResourceHub will **ALWAYS** be free to use. There will be no advertisements whatsoever, unless it is truly necessary.

We are **not** affiliated with the "Crasher Goose". The site has been reported to Google, and we're currently waiting for the site to be taken down.
