# An Official Statement from The ResourceHub Team

![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/desktopgooseunofficial/statement?label=Last%20edit&logo=github)

## Intro

Please check back for updates. This statement will be updated often.

Today (03/09/2020 in DD/MM/YYYY) we were notified about a site distributing a "Crasher Goose". 

The mentioned site can be found at `sites[.]google[.]com/view/crasher-goose/home`. DO NOT GO THERE UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

## Violations of requests and the ResourceHub rules

After further research, we have noticed this site accepts donations for the "Crasher Goose". What's worse, the "Crasher Goose" website seems to be providing paid access to our website. We do not condone this. The download links for the "Crasher Goose" also goes through Linkvertise, which Sam has also asked not to be done. No revenue should be earned off of the Desktop Goose.

However, what's **even** worse, the "Crasher Goose" seems to explicitly **BYPASS** the legal message, which Sam has asked to **NEVER** be done, **EVER**. This is a legal statment that applies to every modded instance of the goose to say that sam is not responsible for any issues that occur while AllowMods is set to true, by bypassing that it is implied that if wanything happened then the creator could be held accountable

## The actual software

### Installation

Installing the "Crasher Goose" seems impossible.

Linkvertise forces you to enable notifications and read articles before you can continue (this should be sketchy to anyone) this also means that you could receive random notifications from them at any time.

This **will** send you NSFW notifications.

Once you do that, you get taken to yet another download page, asking you to get the Linkvertise Download Manager.

Once you do that though - the Linkvertise Download Manager is **unresponsive**. Meanwhile, in the background, the Linkvertise Download Manager sends requests to malicious sites.

The only thing you can do is to exit the Download Manager, which will place a shortcut on your desktop which allows you to open the Download Manager again.

It also seems to be a trojan and adware, thus turning the Desktop Goose into malware.

## Outro

ResourceHub will **ALWAYS** be free to use. There will be no advertisements whatsoever, unless it is truly necessary.

We are **not** affiliated with the "Crasher Goose". The site has been reported to Google, and we're currently waiting for the site to be taken down.
this is something we were expecting to happen but we felt it important to highlight any major ones that are actively being advertised.

Please remember: the only trusted place to download mods is through resourcehub, any other place could pose a substantial risk, we ensure all mods uploaded follow strict guidelines including: showing the source code and not allowing anything that can change the files of a computer or result in the corruption of the game

Even though the goose is a funny little program, these sort of issues are not, we will try our best to stop these sort of programs before they become well known

Thanks for reading
